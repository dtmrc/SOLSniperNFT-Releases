## üî• Features

- Show ranks from howrare and moonrank on supported marketplaces.
  - Howrare has multiple ways of calculating ranking but we show only the following 3 types:
    - HR - this is howrare own ranking system more info <a href="https://howrare.is/faq/#rarity_calculation">here </a>
    - ST - Statistical ranking more info <a href="https://howrare.is/faq/#statistical_rarity">here</a>
    - NT - Normalized traits more info <a href="https://howrare.is/faq/#trait_normalization">here</a>
  - Moonrank supports one type of ranking and this is calculated using statistical ranking system.

## üìñ Extension Settings

- The extension pop-up allows you to :
  - Enable/Disable ranks to be shown.
    ![Settings png](images/Settings.png)
  - Enter your own thresholds and colors for colouring ranks.
  - Enter your own mappings. On mappings page you can enter your own mappings to make sure that we
    find the rankings. The names can be found at the end of the urls:
    - For example if we want to map Solana Monkey Business collection on Magic Eden with rankings from Howrare, you will have the following:
      - Magiceden link : https://www.magiceden.io/marketplace/solana_monkey_business
      - Moonrank link : https://howrare.is/smb
    - We will have to set in the popup the following:
      - Marketplace Collection ID : solana_monkey_businessr
      - Moonrank Collection ID : smb

    	- Now we save the ranks for the NFTs you see in the local storage so when you visit it next time it will be shown faster. Also we don't make a lot of requests to ranking sites anymore.
  - Improved the layout of rankings. (Still some improvements to be done)

    	- Removed statistical rating and normalized traits from howrare (ST, NT) based on user feedback.
   - Added button in the popup to open it in a new page
   - Clear Cached Ranks Page:
     - Added option to clear the rankings. 
      - Now in the popup you can go to the Ranks page and delete the collection you don't see that often or you added a new mapping for it and you want to refresh the ranks on the next page load.

   - Implemented a rate limiter for the requests sent to ranking providers and a sleep and retry process to fetch the  ranks after the temporary block ends.
   - Added code (NF) to inform user to check for mappings.
      - If you see "NF" instead of ranking it means that the rankings are not found.
        - There can be 3 reasons for this : 
            1) The rankings are not provided but this ranking provider. 
            2) You need to add mappings for this new collection.
                NOTE: After you add a new mapping please refresh the page, to request new rankings. 
                    (See Clear Cached Ranks) 
            3) There is a bug with the extension, if you checked that the collection is supported by the ranking provider you have added mappings for it and you still have the issue.Then please contact me (via discord or twitter) and I will try to help you.
        - If you see the loading icon, please wait until the requests are finished. 
          It should take a few seconds. Currently when you try to look at too many NFTs (60 or more in 2-3 seconds by scrolling quickly).it will send all the request to ranking providers. 
          
          Some of them may have limits in place for the amount of requests someone can do, for this reason they may temporarily restrict yuur access to their website for a few seconds.

          But no worries the extension will try to get the rankings again after the temporary ban is lifted, so don't worry and just wait a few and the rankings will show up.

NOTE: To ensure the best experience I advise you to scroll slowly to avoid sending too many requests in a short amount of time.
